# My name is **Tomasz Skoczylas** and I am a self-thought developer.

Back in 2018, I have decided to completely change my career so I could do something that I always enjoyed, which are technology and computer science.
At primary school, as a young pupil, I was always happy to get involved in helping out my computer science teacher. My interest was going beyond subjects that were thought during classes and I have even taken part in additional lectures, which showed me for the very first time how to code in Java. I remember even the time when I was left alone with new computers and made responsible to instal the new operating system - which at that moment was a very responsible job for barely a teenage boy.



Over the last two years, I have dedicated thousands of hours to developing new skills and getting to know new programming languages through internet courses. I found that it was very easy to dive into this subject and have pure enjoyment out of creating a piece of code that actually works as I designed it in my mind. This job gives a lot of challenges as well where I can exercise problem-solving skills. 

It would be my dream to find a job as a junior developer and to get an opportunity to work in a team of like-minded people where I can show my skills, positive attitude and determination to grow.
